                    I love watching movies and reading books. But I also love writing some.
                    Writing is a good way to express your feelings and thoughts without having
                    to say them out loud. I used to write more often before I went to collage
                    and honestly I miss those times. But as soon as I find some inspiration and time,
                    I still know to write some things down.
                    Back in the 2017, when I was only 16 years old I published my first book called "Miss Kejtson".
                    I can't say it was a generally big success, but for me was one of the best things in my life.
                    Later in 2018 it was rewarded as the most read book by a project of "Makedonika Foundation"
                    If anyhow there's a will of yours to read it you can find it on <a href="http://www.makedonika.mk/ShareBook.aspx?id=15190">"Makedonika"</a>.

                    Back in high school I also wrote an English play called "Magic really exists",
                    which was supposed to be a school "theatre" drama for Halloween and not a big deal. But it became a bigger deal.
                    The whole drama was written in rhymes, just like Shakespeare used to do so,
                    although I was and still am way far behind that gentleman. That style made it
                    easier to remember even for people who weren't fluent in English.
                    It took place at "Youth Cultural Center" in Skopje and we had about 250 guests,
                    filling almost the whole hall. The money went to charity which made the show even better.
                    But what I really loved about it is that I got closer to my classmates and friends
                    and seeing them acting out my own words made me proud in many ways. I took a small
                    acting part of it as well.
                    I had a chance to feel what is like to be a screenwriter and a director of a show at a real acting stage.
                    It was a great experience. There's nothing more beautiful than watching your imagination turns into reality.
                    Long story short, it was about a couple of teenagers who didn't want to be the people they are
                    because they were all fighting their own belief system and the one the adult world held.
                    Basically they were going through identity crisis.
                    I can't tell you much more than the name because I only have its cover and the script isn't published,
                    but I can show you one paragraph of it, which I find amusing:

                                        and crying for gone lovers,<br/>
                                        while you can do many things<br/>
                                        that don’t break your wings,<br/>
                                        and be at worthy places<br/>
                                        that don’t put sadness on your faces.<br/>
