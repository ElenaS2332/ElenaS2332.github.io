                Back in high school I used to love architecture. I still love it, but I don't really
                have much time to think about it. Looking back I had a lot of fun doing the projects.
                Sometimes me and my friends would've stayed up all night in the (sometimes very cold) boarding school,
                drawing and then going to school without an hour of sleep. Still, those nights were the best. We were always working in groups,
                even though we had our individual projects, which I must say I miss here on my university,
                because we would always help each other and made sure that none of us was behind.
                That's how we, <i>'the kids from province'</i>, were the best in class. We supported each other.
                And I think there's nothing more beautiful in life than knowing you're not alone.

                        Anyways, I wanted to show you some of the projects I made, or we made, because I really enjoy them
                        and they bring good memories to me. Below is a picture of a drawing from my first project. As you can tell,
                        my coloring skills weren't good. Actually I was never really good at art. Still I tried my best.

                            After a couple of months I got slightly better and there was an update on my coloring
                            (I loved that pink sofa).

                            There is something I really love about this window.

                <div id="secondModel">
                    <div>
                        This was a model we were really proud of.
                        Our teacher even wanted us to attend a competition with it, but then the pandemic happened
                        and unfortunately ruined everything.

                    I think if Covid-19 hadn't happened, things would have been different.
                    Maybe we would've made more incredible things and learn how to love architecture
                    the right way. But then I wouldn't have made this blog, because I would've become a student of architecture,
                    instead of software engineering. But <i>"every path is the right path"</i>, so I'd like to say,
                    I don't regret anything.
