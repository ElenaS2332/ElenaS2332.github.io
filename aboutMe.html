                <h3>Short biography</h3><br/>
                <p>
                    My name is Elena Stamenkovska. I come from Berovo and I am almost <br/>
                    in my twenties. I studied architecture at "Zdravko Cvetkovski" High School <br/>
                    in Skopje, from which I graduated as 'a student of the generation'. <br/>
                    After high school there was a sudden change of hearts, and I ended up <br/>
                    enrolling at Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, <br/>
                    without even knowing what a program is. I was scared and lost, but now <br/>
                    I can surely say I made the right decision. Although I still adore architecture, <br/>
                    I think programming gives more opportunities in different fields. <br/>
                    My passion in life is to explore every single entity I find amusing, because, <br/>
                    as sir Einstein once said: <em>"The important thing is to not stop questioning",</em><br/>
                    and I deeply agree with that.
